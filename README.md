# TouchKit for Vaadin

The easiest way of building a cross-platform mobile user interface for a Java application. Add support for smartphones and tablets in days instead of months, with the tools you are already using.

The master branch contains a Framework 8 compatible version which is not maintained by Vaadin Ltd, but just by community members.

To see how to set up a project using TouchKit and Vaadin 8, refer to this [TouchKit example project](https://github.com/parttio/touchkit-example).
